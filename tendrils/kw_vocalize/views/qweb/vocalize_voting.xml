                        <p>
                            The CSM Infocity Campus Branding Design Challenge is our first invitation-only competition in which participants 
                            are tasked with recommending innovative branding solutions for the exterior, interior and environmental design of 
                            the new campus. The modern workplace has evolved a lot over the past few decades, and the introduction of new 
                            technologies &amp; the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic is set to change the way we work even more in the future. 
                            Work from Home, Hybrid Working and Remote Working is the new normal and CSM is gearing to be prepared for the future 
                            workplace.
                            We have a selected jury panel who will be looking for design solutions that use “attention to detail” through 
                            branding and interior design as a tool to improve the workers' overall wellness, as well as their productivity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, you as a part of CSM have a right to choose your own design for good reasons. 
                            Therefore, we need you to VOTE.
