                            Our website is our front and we put a conscious effort to make it better every day. If you could scroll down on the homepage, you would find an Employee Section with our faces. However, it needs an update and a help from you all.
                            <br/><br/>
    
                            So, put on a smile as we initiate a Photo Collection Drive.
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            What you need to do?
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            1.            Login to Your Oddo Tendrils Profile
                            2.            Click on the link provided and upload your Happy Smiling Picture
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            These photographs will be then updated in our website under Employee Section.
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            This photo of yours will also get stored in the Employee Profile page of Tendrils and can be viewed by you later.
